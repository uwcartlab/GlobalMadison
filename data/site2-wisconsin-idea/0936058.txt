Pub Note	This was clearly inspired by the Andreas Atlases of Iowa and Minnesota - it has much the same format, and is equally well executed. Ristow describes the sad fate of this atlas - Walling and Tackabury published their Atlas of the State of Wisconsin in 1876 (P2633) which greatly reduced the market and thus fewer than 5000 copies of this 1878 atlas were sold, resulting in heavy financial loss and the exhaustion and ultimate demise of Mr. Snyder. H.R. Page acquired the plates and published another expanded edition in 1881 called the Illustrated Historical atlas of Wisconsin (P5079). Atlas is bound in half leather black cloth covered boards with "Illustrated historical atlas of Wisconsin" stamped in gold on the front cover and blind stamped on the back; the spine reads "Historical atlas of Wisconsin. Illustrated. 1878." With printed and hand painted color.
