As well as money, the development of the city required raw materials and labor power. The acquisition of these different inputs helps to underscore the idea that Madison always has been a product of broader regional and global flows. Buildings throughout the city were constructed with materials and labor from across the world. For example, the capitol building is made of rock from six different countries and seven different States. Some of the decorative architecture you can see on older buildings reflects the waves of migrants who arrived in the city from Germany and Scandinavia in the second half of the nineteenth century.", "Landscapes also are shaped in ways that reflect inequalities in power between different population groups. Processes of urbanization in the nineteenth century worked to marginalize the rich cultural histories of native populations who have lived in this area since the Isthmus first was formed ten thousand years ago. Racism and discriminatory regulations have continued to restrict racial diversity across the city to this day. Reading the landscape means paying careful attention to these erasures, and that includes the physical geography of the city."],

The capitol underwent major renovations, costing $140 million,  between 1990 and 2001, which restored rooms to their original appearances and added modern amenities. The heavily visited building, toured by over 50,000 Wisconsin school children each year, has also been home to many political actions. In 2011, tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting “Act 10”, the governor’s proposal effectively ending collective bargaining rights for public employees occupied the building and its surrounds. More recently, demonstrators gathered around the capitol building and surrounding areas in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which exploded nationally in response to the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by police in Minneapolis, MI in May 2020.
