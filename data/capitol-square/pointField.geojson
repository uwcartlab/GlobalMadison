During that time, students frequently led rallies and demonstrations, many of which protested U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Those activities succeeded in mobilizing thousands for and against the war. The tensions and divisions on campus eventually devolved into violence, culminating with the bombing of Sterling Hall, which housed the Army Math Research Center. On August 24, 1970, the explosion killed a Physics researcher, putting a tragic conclusion on a period of protest.</i>"

The Madison Budinessmen's Club used the same site from 1890 to 1906 for the Water Tower Horse Market. The city's 1889 water tower, razed in 1920-21, served as a centerpierce.<br/>City leaders relocated the farmers' market to an indoor in 1910, where it was largely unsuccessful. The building still stands as a Madison landmark at the corner of Mifflin and Blount streets. In 1972, public officials and private vendors reinvigorated this agricultural tradition with the debut of the Dane County Farmers' Market.</i>"
