Today, I am going to be your guide for an interactive walking tour in Madison. On this tour, we will explore the social and physical landscapes of the campus, the capitol, and the near east side of the city. In doing so, we will develop what the Geographer Doreen Massey called “a global sense of place”.", "By this, Massey meant that places are not bounded entities with singular, settled identities. Instead, she encouraged us to think about places as dynamic processes, always in a state of becoming, and full of internal difference. Places are certainly distinctive in their character and topography but these unique qualities are a product of the ever changing ways in which they have been connected to and disconnected from other places and regions.","The tour is designed to help you develop a global sense of the place where we live - Madison. First, you will see how Madison, like any city, has been shaped by its interdependencies with other economies and ecologies around the world. Most case studies of globalization focus on megacities such as New York or Tokyo. But the landscape in Madison also bears the marks of various rounds of regional and global economic restructuring.","Second, by mapping these interdependencies, you will identify the relationship between global economic integration and rising inequalities. Madison occupies a relatively privileged position within global networks of production and trade. But Madison’s prosperity always has been bound together with the impoverishment of other people and places. Moreover, global interdependencies have often exacerbated social-economic inequalities within Madison.","Third, by grounding the global issues in the landscape that surrounds you, I hope to dispel the idea that globalization is something that happens “out there”, beyond our control. Ultimately, the world economy works the way it does because of decisions people make about what to buy, where to invest their money, what political causes to support. If those actions are not promoting the wellbeing of the community and the planet, we can think about alternatives. I want you to reflect on how your own everyday actions impact the lives of others―including those who may otherwise seem distant.","Take a look at the granite boulder you are standing in front of. It commemorates a key aspect of the university’s identity: the Wisconsin Idea. Let’s begin by walking down Bascom Mall toward our second stop.", "In addition to our designated stops, some other landmarks in the city are marked with a red circle on the map. Throughout the tour today, if you see something that interests you, check the map to see if you can find out more information. "],

At its core, that idea is that “the boundaries of the university are the boundaries of the state,” or that the teaching and research undertaken at the university should provide benefits beyond the campus. It is now generally acknowledged that this principle is national and global in scope. A more critical understanding of this idea, recognizes both how the campus has impacted the State and the wider world, and how the State and the world have continually reshaped the university.

Buildings throughout the city were constructed with materials and labor from across the world.

This change in housing stock is referred to as ‘gentrification’ – in the case of student-centered luxury housing it is sometimes called ‘studentification’ – and can be seen especially at this block, known as the “Hub on Campus Madison”, which was completed in 2015. A national real estate development firm called Core Spaces built and runs The Hub, as well as other nearby luxury student housing developments, including The James and ōLiv. While this area is designated by the City as a “preferred area for affordable housing”, fewer than 16% of these buildings comprise middle or low-income apartments. Most rents at these properties are high, even by the Madison rental-market standards, which present challenges to many students. To fill the apartments, the Hub and other luxury student-based housing properties heavily recruit students from wealthy regions and areas of the world, including many cities across Asia. "],
