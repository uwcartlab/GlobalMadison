One of the main reasons why the Badger State Shoe Company relocated from the south of the city to the Isthmus in 1910 was to have better access to labor power. The next stop on this tour is Madison’s Wil-Mar neighborhood, positioned along the famous Williamson, or “Willy”, Street. The Wil-Mar neighborhood you are now entering was originally built as residences for middle classname people working in the manufacturing sector. As industry developed, Willy Street became a busy thoroughfare, prompting the development of a variety of businesses. In the 1960s, the neighborhood became a regional hub for the counterculture movement, promoting an end to the wars in southeast Asia and equality for women and people of color. The Wil-Mar Neighborhood Center, a community center originally built as a church, provides a good opportunity to reflect on how the demographics and values of the neighborhood residents have evolved during this time." ],

The first gaslights appeared along these streets in 1855, and the first electrical lighting arrived in the 1880s. The Madison Gas & Electric Company was established on the Isthmus in 1902. Coal was transported to the plant along the old train tracks you just explored and then burned as fuel, with CO2 released through the signature four smokestacks. This helped fuel a significant expansion in Madison’s industrial base during the first half of the twentieth century. The plant is still in operation today, but in 2011 it was converted from a coal-burning facility to one that only utilizes natural gas." ],
